\begin{abstract}
	At its core, my project - real-time trading platform, will allow users to participate in trades with other users in real-time, and also allow users to list their own assets which they which to sell. The price of buying and selling is entirely determined by the amount at which users decide to buy and sell assets, very similar to a stock exchange.
	
	At a glance, the project does not seem entirely exciting, but it takes inspiration from the great stock exchanges in the world: London Stock Exchange (LSE), and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), inspiration not because they are innovative ideas, but because of the cheer amount of data that these institutions needs to process every second.
	
	My project aims to go a step further than regular stock exchanges, apart from aiming at having 24 hours a day up-time, which enables users to buy and sell at any time of the day, I also want to provide the ability for users to list their own assets, which will provide a new way to sell.
	
	The primary objective of my project is to provide real-time, blazingly fast service to the users exchanging assets. This is also the hardest part of the entire project, because everything will have to be built to not just handle hundreds of requests a second, but also scale to meet thousands of requests a second, providing a great challenge on my software architecture, as well as my backend design.
	
	There are plenty of services that provide a buying/selling platform, however these are usually for a fixed price and for a one time exchange, my platform will allow users to sell their assets in a much more interesting and potentially beneficial way, by strategically selling and buying.

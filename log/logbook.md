# Log book - Individual Project (Advanced Web Development)

## 29/09/2022
First entry in the log book. This week I have taken the time to get organised, finalise my project idea and talk to my superviser about it. I finalised the list of features that I wanted to have in the final product. Also got a draft of my plan.

## 02/10/2022
Finish the draft of the report, but does not yet include the bibliography. Still need to walk through the marking grid and tick all the boxes.

## 03/10/2022
Adding references to my plan - still not finished.

## 05/10/2022
Added testing, how currency will work and core and optional features to the plan.

## 07/10/2022
Finished the plan, submitting it today.

## 11/10/2022
Started implementing the "hub" service, which is the first point of contact from the user.

## 12/10/2022
Beginning template for the frontend application with all the dependencies installed.

## 24/10/2022
It has been a while since I have made an alternation on my individual project, I have been poorly and focusing on my other subjects, but now I am back in full force.
Today:
- Setup docker file for the hub micro service and a docker compose file to allow for easy deployment and development.
- Created a diagram for the overall system architecture.

## 25/10/2022
Connected frontend to the backend using websocket connection. I am still a week behind on my plan so I will have to work very hard this week to get back on schedule.

## 31/10/2022
Added RabbitMQ docker image, and created a test connection between hub and rabbitmq, it works.

## 05/11/2022
Setup the SQL schemas for the required databases.

## 06/11/2022
Started work on the authentication system.

## 07/11/2022
Finished register method in auth system, with some very nice code.

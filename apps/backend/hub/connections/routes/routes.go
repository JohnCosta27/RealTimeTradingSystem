package routes

// File to maintain all the routes constants in one file
// This allows you to change once, and change all the paths
// in the entire application
// Might be useful in the future for this to be a shared package,
// between the frontend and the backend, stored in a JSON file or
// something similar.

const HEALTH_ROUTE = "/health"
const HEALTH_AUTH_ROUTE = "/health-auth"
